Elasticsearch List
=========================

An Elasticsearch plugin that lists installed plugins.

Installation
------------

To install this plugin just use the `plugin` command from Elasticsearch itself. The location of the `plugin` command may vary, depending on how you installed Elasticsearch. The command to install is:

```
bin/plugin --install notonthehighstreet/elasticsearch-list
```

After installation, open it on the browser. If installed locally, the default URL would be `http://localhost:9200/_plugin/list`.
